# Dashboard Research Summary

### Mar 14 – Apr 1



### Research Overview

The primary goal of user research and usability testing for the last 3 weeks has been to test and validate several different dashboard concepts and features, using two sets of clickable wireframes, representing two possible flows and interaction concepts: [flow A](https://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/UP70ZUQFD#/screens), [flow B](https://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/UP70ZUQFD#/screens/152282020).



### How to use this doc

The purpose of this document is to provide a summary of findings from the interview and usability sessions conducted on the two dashboard concepts. The findings are organized by screen, into “validating” and “refine” buckets- to indicate where the concepts are on track, and where users encountered confusion or obstacles, and therefore are opportunities to learn and potentially make refinements or change directions.

The findings are synthesized to a moderate degree - meaning that important patterns across the interviews have been identified, but further work is needed (either by the PM or UX lead, or ideally a collaboration amongst the team) to carry the findings forward - whether that is choosing a direction and refining, or opting to try a new approach that better meets the needs described below.



### Target Users

Based on previous discovery research work, we believe that a “dashboard-style” experience, incorporating elements like high-level aggregated campaign finance data views, would address some of the critical needs of our novice users, including:

- Engaged public
- Journalists new to the campaign finance beat


### Needs (desired outcomes of our work)

The needs we are attempting to address with the dashboard concepts and features were discovered through an [earlier round of novice user discovery research](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Byjrf_t-6q4ZZ19iWktoZkhDV1U).  Those key needs include:

- A way to get an introduction to the world of campaign finance and a sense of the information available on the site
- A way to get a quick look at key high-level facts
- An easy way to explore high-level data that allows and encourages easy connections and flows into the underlying data set
- A means of exploring the high-level data that prompts further exploration, piques curiosity and inspires questions and ideas
- An easy path to explore campaign finance information at the “right level” for the user— both novice/high level, as well as advanced/detailed data


### Primary research questions

- Which concepts and features best teach users about the kind of information on the site?
- Which concepts and features best help users understand key information, such as the total amounts raised and who the top raisers are?
- Which (if any) concepts and features inspire users to ask new questions or probe further? What questions?


### Users interviewed

- 7 engaged members of the public, including:
    - UX designer
    - Public library employee
    - National education nonprofit employee
    - Finance attorney
    - Several others who did not disclose their professions

- 2 members of political action type groups, including:
    - PAC Political director
    - Political nonprofit, prospect researcher

- 2 journalists, including
    - Novice political reporter & manager, international news org
    - Novice campaign finance reporter & data journalism student

### Insights

### Dashboard Findings

#### Landing screen (A and B)

Validating

- (Both A+B) Prominent search was very positively received by users who typically looked for specific entities, but was less frequently seen as a path for general exploration
- Search path is less often used, but still seen by some users as their primary entry point into the content.
    - Example: One user’s mental model and general approach to discovery: Start with a specific entity, and search to get information about and surrounding that entity

- (Both) Curated content (presidential race charts) inspired unplanned action/engagement
- (Both) Landing page successfully viewed as the “state of play” for the current moment



Refine

- (A) Several users conflated the “Spending by Category” chart in Money Spent with the “Top spending PACs” chart (and same pattern in money raised) and were confused
- (A) “Money Spent” section seemed opaque to many users, even somewhat expert users— however the impression of the section improved with the specific question-based prompts
    - Some users were confused by terminology: “Operating expenditures, Independent expenditures"
    - More expert user asked why data was displayed differently in spending than raising (e.g., by candidate, by quarter)

- (Both) When asked where contributions are coming from (to find info geographically) it was frequently unclear to users how to get there- (one wondered if search was universal or not)
- (A) Users were mixed on “explore” buttons: perceived as a possible path, but was vague.
    - (B) Specific questions were somewhat more successful at getting engagement

- (Both) Users expressed desire to be able to dive into detail at any point while exploring data— e.g., when a candidate’s name comes up- be able to get to that candidate’s detailed page
- (B) One user said she expected the question-based prompt (on B landing) to lead to a more narrative-driven breakdown of the question (e.g., who is raising the most) with more context, vs data-driven
- (Both) Some novice users were interested in going directly to the advanced data tables, and often used them in response to tasks, when they were visible on the page
- (Both) Users generally expected to see more context when interacting with graphs in the mockups (graph labels and data on hover)
- (Both) “Top” lists (e.g., top raising candidates) were most intriguing to novice users, less intriguing to more experienced users

#### Overview (A)

Validating

- Map was met with a lot of positive response. A few users expressed a desire to make comparisons here
- Users pretty consistently expressed more interest in Super PACs than party committees (which also seemed generally less understood)


Refine

- Users frequently wanted more context and rules (e.g., candidate fundraising rules, Super PAC rules, what are candidates spending on and the rules around that), but also frequently did not read the definitions/descriptive paragraphs on the page
- One user wanted to get to independent expenditures and individual donors from this view, but was unclear how to do so (possibly did not understand that “campaign finance data” at the top of the page was a navigation option)


#### Detail screen: (A 3.1) Candidate Fundraising and (B 3.1) Candidate Activity

Validating

- One user expressed explicit preference for these views, over downloading and manipulating data herself
- Users mentioned desire to be able to share a particular view of the graphs with a colleague. Generally, all the visualizations and graphs were well received in terms of content.  A few even inspired specific comments like "The source of income is really interesting because it’s something I wouldn’t have thought about before”
- Advanced users expressed desire to take the financial comparisons (B3.1) graph even farther: "It would be cool if you could change from “all presidential candidates” (above graph) to [a specific candidate] which could...be pretty powerful to look for a lot of specific information in one spot..."


Refine

- All of the two-tone horizontal bar graphs were generally difficult for users to interpret: "I don’t quite know what to make of the light and dark part of the bar.” (e.g. “How are candidates raising money?” graph)
- More expert users sought to be able to compare specific races to one another


### Navigation Findings (specifically mega-menu testing)



Validating

- Users generally anchored their sense of place using the page title (not breadcrumbs), but they basically always did find breadcrumbs when asked to navigate
- Users universally understood the broader &gt; narrower pattern of the breadcrumbs
-  Advanced data, seemed to understand first option and what each would take him to (for example, PACs = breakdown of PACs)


Refine

- Users were very uncertain about the “Explore” button in the navigation: no one one was able to anticipate the button’s function
- “All candidates” was a phrase that a number of users were unsure what this would encompass
- The expanded menu (all the options) helped orient users to the types of content available in the site:
    - More experienced users preferred fuller navigation, which they felt provided them a more clear view of what options existed
        - Users typically used the category names to make sense of the options
        - They also felt like they weren’t “missing anything” by seeing all options laid out

- Navigation terms in the full menu were often perceived as jargony
    - As an example, one user wasn’t able to find contributions because he didn’t mentally connect with the term “receipts”

- One user perceived an inconsistency in the navigation “depth” between “Overviews” and “Advanced datatables” options


### Other Findings

Validating

- Expert users always wanted access to underlying data, confidence is “knowing the data is complete" — for example: "I am always drawn to databases, because I know if I understand the database, I feel extremely confident in the answer I get from it."
- Users (both expert and novice) expressed desire to control the views presented, e.g. wanted further interactivity


Refine

- One or two expert users wanted to double check accuracy/validity of beta site- “is it ready for use?"
- One user was possibly interested in downloading and using the data directly, but not confident (self-confidence) about how to go about using the data once downloaded
