# Clara Lewis | Lawyer

Campaign lawyer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## "I don't have confidence that I'm getting full results for my searches"

## "If a client called and asked how much they could spend to support a candidate, I'd start with the statute, go to the reg, go to the AO, go to enforcement matters, the legislative history, the rulemakings, the commission discussions on open meetings for advisory opinions or rulemakings, and court cases"

# Frank Aker | Individual Filer

Chief at ThoughtPAC

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## "Whatever you do, people see it. Any little mistake you make is magnified. People see it and you don't know who's going to take it out of context"

### Motivation

Frank is fed up with the short-sightedness he sees in some of the politicians representing his state and is taking a stand. He's part of a facebook group of like-minded, politically active individuals, and they share links and support. One close colleague, Gabe has been a great help to him, mentoring him to take his political activity to the next level with a PAC.

### Goals

- He wants to effect political change.
- He wants to know he is complying with the law (before filing)

### Frustrations

- Getting started has a steep learning curve
- Complying feels complicated and full of potentially disastrous pitfalls
- Not knowing his status with the FEC, e.g., if his filing was successful



# Melanie Strauss | Professional Filer Analyst at Franklin, McDermott & Price

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## "Everything is due at the same time."

### Motivation

Melanie has always been interested in politics but prefers to stay out of the limelight. She worked at the FEC in the past but now works at a law firm where she is focuses on helping political campaigns maintain compliance with the FEC's dates and rules.

### Goals

- Advocate for clients, keep them from making embarrassing errors
- Comply with local, state, Federal, and FEC guidelines.
- Stay up-to-date with regard to FEC rulings
- Maintain a good work-life balance. Work from home more often. She has a husband, Tony, and 7 year old daughter, Eliza.

### Frustrations

- Many commonsensical rules of accounting don't apply to working with the FEC. "A lot of time the campaigns will hire someone with an accounting background to do this this stuff, but the FEC's rules are totally different."
- Searching for Advisory Opinions produces inconsistent results
- Many accounting rules don't apply to working with the FEC.
- Clients defer/abdicate their responsibility to disclose credits/disbursements in a timely fashion.
- Some of her clients are registered in 10+ states, each with their own rules and reporting deadlines.
- Always a crunch to review near filing time.
