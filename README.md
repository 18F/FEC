# Federal Election Commission

[18F](http://18f.gsa.gov) is exploring a reimagined website for the [Federal Election Commission](http://www.fec.gov). We're still in the early stages of this project, but would love your ideas about how we can help make the FEC's online presence more user-friendly, accessible, and elegant. Our project is focused on technical solutions we can provide to improve the FEC's online presence and will not address anything that would initiate or require changes to FEC policies, guidance, or regulations.

We encourage use of the [issues tracker](https://github.com/18F/fec/issues) for specific requests or ideas. We also welcome [pull requests](https://github.com/18F/fec/pulls) if you want to be bold and suggest a specific approach or implementation!

We plan to use this repository as a place to share our work and direction, but please don't consider anything you see here to be final or production-ready. This is still very much in beta.
