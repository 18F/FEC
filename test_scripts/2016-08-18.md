## Introduction script:

Hi, I'm **___**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We're asking people to try using the website and take a look at some of the designs we're working on today, to see if everything works as intended. This session should take about 25 to 30 minutes.

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we're testing the site, not you. You can't do anything wrong here. In fact, this might  be the one part of your day where you don't have to worry about making any mistakes.

Although it may seem a little weird, I'm going to ask you to think out loud as much as possible as you use the site. Describe what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This will be a huge help to us.

Also, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.

If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people do when they don't have someone sitting next to them to help. But,if you still have any questions when we're done, I'll try to answer them them. Sound okay? (credit: Krug)

## Introduction questions:
First, we'd like to spend a minute learning a bit more about your background.

- What do you know about the FEC?
	- What does the FEC do?
- What is your interest in campaign finance?
- What data did you use when you last went to the FEC website?

# Live site tasks
(Test on [beta site > campaign finance data main page](https://beta.fec.gov))

Fist we're going to access our "beta" site. The beta site is a real, working website where we continually release new features. We are going to show you some of these features today.

## Raising overview graph questions:
[Scroll down to the “Raising” graph]

- What is this graph telling you? (Expected answers: comparing how much money different groups raised over time; party committees raising the most; total amount raised at certain points)

- Do you see any trends on the graph?

- What do the numbers on the right mean? (Expected answer: how much money different groups raised during the indicated date range)
	- If they don’t make the connection to the graph, probe about “what does the dotted line mean”?

- _ask if it doesn't come out naturally_ After looking at this graph, are you curious about anything or have any questions in your mind about campaign finance fundraising?

## Desktop filter tests
Test on [beta site > advanced data > filings](https://beta.fec.gov/data/advanced/filings)

Okay, we’re finished reviewing these charts, and we're going to move on to a different feature of the site. To begin our new activity, I am going to present you with a scenario. If you would like me to repeat the scenario at any point, feel free to ask. Are you ready?

- Okay. Imagine that you have come to this website in order to find the July monthly report that was filed to the FEC by a committee called "Hillary for America." Where on this website would you go to do that?
	- _if it didn't happen naturally_ [Direct the user to the Filings page]

- Okay, now that we are here, please try to find the July monthly report that was filed to the FEC by the "Hillary for America" committee. (Expected behavior:  types "Hillary for America" in filer field; expands "Report Type" and selects "July report" from monthly reports).

- What would you do to see all the different types of of filings submitted by the Hillary for America committee, rather than just the monthly reports?

- What options do you have for adjusting the data displayed on this page? (Expected answers: Filtering by data type, filer, filing date, filing information, report type)

- Toward the top left of this screen, there are buttons that read "Processed" and "eFilings." What do those terms mean to you?
	- _if it didn't happen naturally_ [Direct the user to the tooltip] Does this information available via this information icon help you to understand these terms?

- TBD: Some task re: filters apply to processed but not to efilings

- Follow ups:
	- TBD
