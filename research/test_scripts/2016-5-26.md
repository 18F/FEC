## Introduction Script:

Hi, I'm **_**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We're asking people to try using the website and take a look at some of the designs we're working on today, to see if everything works as intended. This session should take about 25 - 30 minutes.

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we're testing out the site, not you. You can't do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don't have to worry about making mistakes.

So this may feel a little weird, but as you use the site, I'm going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: say what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This is be a huge help to us.

Also, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.

If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people do when they don't have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we're done I'll try to answer them them. Sound ok? (credit: Krug)

Script: Give us a quick 1 minute your background. What do you know about the FEC? What does the FEC do?

## Task 1: IA

1. **You'd like to stay up to date on new developments that will impact the rules and operations of the FEC? How would you do that?** _(We want to see if they go newsletter/press/record/tips/etc.)_

2. **You want to learn more about what types of reports candidates need to file and when. Where would you go to learn more?** _(We want to see if they go registration and reporting essentials for candidates)_

3. **You saw that an individual contributor gave $2,000 to a candidate, and you want to know if that was more than the maximum amount they're allowed to give.** _(We want to see if they go contribution limits)_

4. **You know the FEC occasionally resolves disputes using a program called the Alternative Dispute Program. Where would you go to find more information about this?** _(We want to see if they go to Legal Resources or Enforcement)_

## Task 2: Calendar

- Pretend you are a monthly filer. How would you find out when the next filing is due? How would you subscribe to the quarterly filing schedule?
- Imagine that you're going to be visiting DC in May and that you'd like to attend an FEC meeting that's open to the public. Can you find one on the FEC calendar? How would you add this event to your own calendar?
- How many executive sessions are there this quarter?

## Task 3: type-ahead & filtering

- Use the site to find out who Bill Gates has supported.
- Can you also check and see if other people in his family have given?
- (if they don't search for william) Now Bill, as you can likely guess, is short for William. Can you find out if he has given as William?

## Wrap-up Script:

Before we wrap up, do you have any questions or comments for our team?
