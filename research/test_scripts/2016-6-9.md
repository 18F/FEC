## Introduction Script:

Hi, I'm **_**, and I'm working on the Federal Election Commission website redesign. We're asking people to try using the website and take a look at some of the designs we're working on today, to see if everything works as intended. This session should take about 25 - 30 minutes.

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we're testing out the site, not you. You can't do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don't have to worry about making mistakes.

So this may feel a little weird, but as you use the site, I'm going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: say what you're looking at, what you're trying to do, and what you're thinking. This is be a huge help to us.

Also, please don't worry that you're going to hurt our feelings. We're doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.

If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people do when they don't have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we're done I'll try to answer them them. Sound ok? (credit: Krug)

Script: Give us a quick 1 minute your background. What do you know about the FEC? What does the FEC do?

# Tasks:

test on staging. is it possible to check mobile things remotely? i would be interested in checking interactions on the new mobile menu:

## Task 1 Mobile Menu (candidate search) :

- link: mobile [beta.fec.gov](https://beta.fec.gov/) We want to try out how folks use the site, while using mobile devices. Let's say you're standing in line at the grocery store and hear something on the radio about Bernie Sanders fundraising and you'd like to find out how much he raised this election cycle in his bid for president.

## Task 2 Mobile Menu (committee detail):

- link, if 1 was failed: mobile [direct link to sanders](https://beta.fec.gov/data/candidate/P60007168/) How much did Sanders raise from individuals giving more than $2,000?

## Task 3 Mobile Menu (individual contributions) :

- link: mobile [beta.fec.gov](https://beta.fec.gov/)
- Ok, let's switch gears. You're still on your mobile device, and you read an article about very large contributions, one of the names you caught was Ronald Cameron. See if you can find his donations.

_for a note on why these mobile tasks were chosen see below [## Note on mobile tasks]_

## Task 4: Individual Contributions transaction cycle on desktop :

- link: [feature](https://fec-feature-proxy.18f.gov/data/receipts/?transaction_period=2016&min_date=01-01-2015&max_date=12-31-2016)
- Ok now lets say you want to continue looking through individual contributors, but you're back at a desktop computer. You want to compare the number of large donations of over 1 million from individuals in May 2015 to the same time before the last election, May 2011\. Try to use the site to do that.

## Task 5: Calendar

- link: [beta.fec.gov]
- Pretend you run a committee in New Jersey and are required to file with the FEC. You know that you had to file a report on your committees fundraising before the primary election that happened earlier this week. How would find out when that deadline was?
- Continue to pretend you run a committee and file monthly. How would you find out when the next filing is due?
- Imagine that you're going to be visiting DC in May and that you'd like to attend an FEC meeting that's open to the public. Can you find one on the FEC calendar? How would you add this event to your own calendar?

then the new state filtering on the calendar. on the state filtering, we'd be looking to see if people understand what the state filter applies to, and what it doesn't

## Note on mobile tasks

According to analytics, top actions to fec.gov on mobile between 6/2016 and 6/2015 were the following:

- [candidate & committee viewer](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/candcmte_info.shtml),
- [individual contributor search](http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/norindsea.shtml),
- committee detail like [this one for Bernie Sanders](http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?tabIndex=1&candidateCommitteeId=S4VT00033)and the
- [disclosure map](http://www.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do), so we'll use these as fodder for tasks.
