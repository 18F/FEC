## Initial Directional Research Summary

In developing the first public release of beta.fec.gov, we uncovered that there was a lot of terminology and rules affecting the comprehension of folks relatively new to campaign finance. Through a research sprint targeting this, we uncovered the following high level goals for novice users:

- A way to get an introduction to the world of campaign finance and a sense of the information available on the site
- A way to get a quick look at key high-level facts
- An easy way to explore high-level data that allows and encourages easy connections and flows into the underlying data set
- A means of exploring the high-level data that prompts further exploration, piques curiosity and inspires questions and ideas
- An easy path to explore campaign finance information at the "right level" for the user-- both novice/high level, as well as advanced/detailed data

From this, two mock-ups were created for concept testing, representing two possible flows and interaction concepts: [flow A](https://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/UP70ZUQFD#/screens), [flow B](https://gsa.invisionapp.com/share/UP70ZUQFD#/screens/152282020).
