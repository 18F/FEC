### Graph Overview Notes

- User failed to find or see the date of the `in-progress date` fast enough to satisfy their experience.

  - :wrench: Increase prominence of when the data in each chart has been most recently updated
  - :wrench: to clarify or indicate when data was last updated use timestamp or other feature that communicates timeliness

### Graphic visualization style

- :large_orange_diamond: On the Totals Graph, Diagonal lines (grey lines over colored bars) may be hard for users to read.:no_issue: [link to script]()
- :large_orange_diamond: Testing participant noted the time periods are not the same in each chart of the graph. She didn't notice this right off the bat, but said this is kind of "misleading."

  - possible :wrench: Make sure we consistently frame time periods the same way as we report data.
